### Overview

Since CapRover uses containers for all services, including NGINX, containers cannot access each otherâ€™s data directly.
To serve media files, NGINX needs access to them. However, if your Django project is configured to use file storage, it will store files inside its container (or a volume, depending on your configuration).
The solution is to use a shared folder that both containers can access:

1. The NGINX container provides a shared folder located at `/nginx-shared`.
2. By configuring Django to write media files into this shared folder, NGINX can serve them.

An advantage of this solution is that it is similar to using a volume, meaning you will not lose your media files when the container is restarted.

### Step 1: Update Django Media Settings

Add or update the following settings in your `settings.py` file:

```python
# Django media settings
STORAGES = {
    "BACKEND": "django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage",
}
MEDIA_ROOT = APPS_DIR / "media"
MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
```

**Assumptions**:
- The project name is `myjourney` (also the `APPS_DIR`).
- In the running container, the project resides in `/app`, so media files are located in `/app/myjourney/media`.

### Step 2: Use the CapRover Shared Directory

CapRoverâ€™s NGINX container offers a shared folder for storing data accessible by other containers(Check [here](https://caprover.com/docs/nginx-customization.html#custom-files-and-directories) for more details.):
- **Host Path**: `/captain/data/nginx-shared`
- **Container Path**: `/nginx-shared`

#### 1. Create the Media Directory

On the host, create a media folder in the shared directory: `/captain/data/nginx-shared/myjourney/media`

#### 2. Configure CapRover to Use the Shared Directory

In CapRoverâ€™s app configuration, set up a persistent directory:

- **Path in App**: `/app/myjourney/media`
- **Path on Host**: `/captain/data/nginx-shared/myjourney/media`

> *Note*: Do not let CapRover manage this path automatically.

### Step 3: Update NGINX Configuration

Add a `location` block to serve media files from the shared folder:

```nginx
location /media/ {
    alias /nginx-shared/myjourney/media/;
}
```

Be sure to update the configuration in both your NGINX servers.

And thatâ€™s it! Your Django project should now be able to serve media files using NGINX. ðŸš€
